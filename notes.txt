To position a small abstract PNG behind a group of text that doesn't cover the entire background and always stays in place behind that particular group of text, you can use the CSS "position" property with the value "absolute" to position the PNG relative to a container element, such as a div that contains the text.

You could do this as follows:

HTML:

<div class="container">
  <div class="background"></div>
  <div class="text">
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <p>Text content goes here</p>
  </div>
</div>
CSS:

css
Copy code
.container {
  position: relative; /* set the container to a relative position */
}

.background {
  position: absolute; /* set the PNG to an absolute position */
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  z-index: -1; /* move the PNG behind the text */
  background-image: url('path/to/abstract-image.png');
  background-position: right top; /* set the position of the PNG relative to the container */
  background-size: auto; /* set the size of the PNG */
  background-repeat: no-repeat; /* prevent the PNG from repeating */
}

.text {
  padding: 20px; /* add padding to create space between the PNG and the text */
}
In this example, the "container" element is set to a 
relative position, which creates 
a positioning context for the absolute positioned
 "background" element. The "background" element is 
 then positioned absolutely and given a "z-index" 
 property of -1, which moves it behind the text.

The "background-position" property is used to set the 
position of the PNG relative to the container, and the 
"background-size" property is used to adjust the size of 
the PNG. Finally, the "padding" property is added to the 
"text" element to create space between the PNG and the 
text.

Note that you may need to adjust the CSS properties 
based on the specific PNG and text you are working 
with, and it's important to test the page on different 
devices to ensure that the positioning of the PNG works 
well on all screen sizes.
